Helper library for DAOs.  Inspired by the great Hodor himself.  Boilerplate persistence code tends to be like him -- simple and repetitive.

Hodor hodor hodor persist. Hodor hodor hodor merge.  Hodor hodor hodor delete.  Hodor HODOR!

Hodao takes advantage of Apache TomEE's abstract-bean concept.  The DAO is declared abstract and boilerplate methods can be simply annotated and handled by the framework.  Unlike purely interface-based approaches, this still allows you to use plain Java code for persistence logic that falls outside what the framework handles.

The guts of the "framework" are [less than 500 lines of code](https://github.com/tomitribe/hodao/blob/master/src/main/java/org/tomitribe/hodao/impl/PersistenceHandler.java).  The rest is pure annotations.  **Copy/paste reuse encouraged, forks encouraged, _change it to fit you_!**
