# Tomitribe Open Source Branding/Productization

- Get list of included products/projects
- Buy tomitribe.io
- Give free space by not using tomitribe.com
- Use alternate colors to split between corporate and open source
- Distinct leader (despot) at the early phase, feedback loop in later phase
- Add Project in Timetracking to see and reward participation, gauge effort -- helps our estimation for future branding 
- Opportunity for Ryan and Thiago to learn to work together
- Failure is acceptable
- Rename http-signatures-java and crest-ssh-connector
- Announcemnt of tomitribe.io

# Spring.io

Essential elements we must have:

 - Projects are listed in a grid 
 - Each project has a logo
 - All the logos have a consistent feel
 - Short description of projects - two sentences max
 

# Main Page (Projects list)

We need a hybrid of these two pages as our main page

 - http://spring.io
 - http://spring.io/projects

Essential elements:

 - We want a small splash area at the top
 - All projects must be listed (grid preferred)
 - Project representation should be minimal: logo and short description (two sentences tops)
 -- Do not load the main page up with other project links (those can go in the project page itself)
 - Link to tomitribe.com in footer of every page
 - Tomitribe.io description that this is a community site, "trove of tribe tools and projects"

Non-essential points:

 - Blogs section.  Not needed yet.
 - No guides or docs yet either.  Documentation for each project can go on the project page, but not needed on the main page.  Tomitribe.io isn't a "platform" so no need to present it as such with a "getting started" or other type of media on the main page.  Again "getting started" is fine for each project's page.

# Project Page

Best examples:

 - http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
 - https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/catalog/desktop.html
 - 
Essential elements:

 - Small splash area with larger version of logo, more descriptive text
 - Feature list
 - Maven coordinates
 - Quick start
 - Version list
 - Documentation link

# Documentation Page

Essential elements

 - Table of contents
 - Numbered sections
