# Tomitribe Open Source Branding/Productization

- Get list of included products/projects
- Buy tomitribe.io
- Give free space by not using tomitribe.com
- Use alternate colors to split between corporate and open source
- Distinct leader (despot) at the early phase, feedback loop in later phase
- Add Project in Timetracking to see and reward participation, gauge effort -- helps our estimation for future branding 
- Opportunity for Ryan and Thiago to learn to work together
- Failure is acceptable
- Rename http-signatures-java and crest-ssh-connector
- Announcemnt of tomitribe.io

# Spring.io

Best example of what we need: http://spring.io

Essential elements we must have:

 - Projects are listed in a grid http://spring.io/projects
 - Each project has a logo
 - All the logos have a consistent feel
 - Short description of projects - two sentences max
 
Non-essential points:

 - Spring.io main page (main page will be the projects page)
 - Blogs section.  Not needed yet.
 - No guides or docs yet either.  Documentation for each project can go on the project page, but not needed on the main page.
